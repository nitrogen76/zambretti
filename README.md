# zambretti

Quick and dirty code to implement a zambretti forecast, originally written for [cheapWeather](https://github.com/nitrogen76/cheapweather)
It still needs work, but seeing that a simple , portable implementation was nonexistant, I whipped this up.

Most fixes will initially go into [cheapWeather](https://github.com/nitrogen76/cheapweather) but will get backported here eventually.
